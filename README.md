performance and customer behavior. The project consists of six tasks that involve data cleaning, data analysis, and visualization using
Excel.

Data Cleaning
•	Removed any duplicate in unique column in four sheets of dataset
•	Ensure all columns contents in one and proper format by formatting state in short form and gender in long form and converting all numerical data from text to number format
•	Clearing gaps, removing space by n/a

Customer Segmentation
•	Segmentation by Wealth Segment - Average of tenure is highest for high net worth and There are half of customers are mass customers
•	Segmentation by Gender - Average of bike related purchase is nearly same and for undefined count is vary less so we can ignore that, male average purchase show more positive trend
•	Segmentation by Job Industry -Number of customers is highest in case of manufacturing and financial services and only in case of manufacturing affluent customer count is more than high net worth
Transaction Analysis
•	June and September have less sales and October have high
•	For standard product line sum of list price is 70% of total and for touring average sales high which indicates to focus on standard and touring product line
•	Average number of purchases for customer is 5.7

New Customer Insights
•	New Customer Demographics - Average past_3_years_bike_related_purchases =49.83
•	New Customer Location Analysis -
1.	As there increase in property valuation, overall wealth segment also increases for all category
2.	The number of customers is high for property valuation 7,8, and 9 and highest for 9 but after 9 valuation we see decrease in customers
3.	Correlation value is 0.031278 which shows weak positive relationship between property valuation and helper column which created by assigning numerical value to wealth segment, shows directly proportional relationship but weak and insignificant for analysis

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis
•	For telecommunication average CLV is highest but count of customers is less
•	For agriculture average CLV is worst and for manufacturing and Financial Services it is vary less which must improve because both have high costumer count
•	For male average CLV is high and for undefined it is highest but it is for vary less count of costumer CLV so we cannot consider

Project Insight for Sales Performance Impact
•	Increase the number of customers of telecommunication job industry due to its high CLV value
•	Improve CLV of manufacturing and financial service job industry due to its high customer count
•	In product line focusing more on standard and touring lead to increase business
•	We can’t ignore benefits in business policy and product development for mass customer due to its high count
•	We must increase high net worth customers for company long term growth due to high tenuity of high-net-worth customers
•	Targeting male customer is better because its showing better trend on bike purchasing and CLV compared to other gender
•	Targeting property valuation of mid-range that is 7,8,9, etc. can be beneficial.
